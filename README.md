A couple of things I would like to see in a Public Relations /market plan is 
1. anti scam research effort. (Address stuff like cryptobridge phishing) 
2. Telegram room moderations (lets keep the discussion professional, clean and polite. 
3. more user tutorials and onboarding efforts 
4. minnor adwords/banner facebook campaign (test small things now so we can expand later as needed) 
5. official social media channels.   

Now how much and what else to include of these, well that is a good discussion.
